    <h2>Week03</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="object_quiz.html">Take a quiz</a> - This is the same quiz as week 2. However,<br>
        it uses objects instead of nested arrays.<br>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        - Chapter 5: - All objects are mutable at any time when a program is running.<br> 
        This means that its properties and methods can be changed or removed, and new<br> 
        properties and methods can be added to the object, even if it was declared using const.<br>
        To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces. The following example<br>
        creates an empty object that is assigned to the variable spiderman :<br>
        const spiderman = {};<br>
        The above example is the preferred method of creating an object, and is an object literal notation.<br>
        ES6 provided a shorthand method of creating objects if a property key is the same as a variable name<br> 
        that the property value is assigned to:<br>
        const name = 'Iron Man';<br>
        const realName = 'Tony Stark';<br>
        // long way<br>
        const ironMan = { name: name, realName: realName };<br>
        // short ES6 way<br>
        const ironMan = { name, realName };<br>
        Dot notation is much more common, but bracket notation has a few advantages: it's the only way to access<br> 
        nonstandard property and method names that don’t follow the variable naming rules. It also lets you evaluate<br> 
        an expression and use it as the property key:<br>
        const superman = {<br>
          name: 'Superman',<br>
          'real name': 'Clark Kent',<br>
          height: 75,<br>
          weight: 235,<br>
          hero: true,<br>
          villain: false,<br>
          allies: ['Batman','Supergirl','Superboy'],<br>
          fly() {<br>
              return 'Up, up and away!';<br>
          }<br>
        };<br>
        superman["real" + " " + "name"] // the property is built using string concatenation<br>
        << "Clark Kent"<br>
        The expression 'real name' was used as the property key.<br> 
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        - Chapter 7:<br>
        ul id='list'<br>
          li -one- li<br>
          li -two- li<br>
          li -three- li<br>
        ul<br>
        If you click on one of the <em>li</em> elements, you’re also clicking on the <em>ul</em> , <em>body</em><br> 
        and <em>html</em> elements. An event is said to propagate as it moves from one element to another.<br>
        Event propagation is the order that the events fire on each element. There are two forms<br> 
        of event propagation: bubbling and capturing.<br>
        Bubbling is when the event fires on the element clicked on first, then bubbles up the document tree,<br> 
        firing an event on each parent element until it reaches the root node.<br><br>
        Capturing starts by firing an event on the root element, then propagates downwards, firing an event<br> 
        on each child element until it reaches the target element that was clicked on.<br>
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Are symbols a preferred way of creating property keys?
          </li>
          <li>
            Will you please look at my object_quiz.js code and give me feedback?
