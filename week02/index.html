        which has the advantage of being able to use both types of quote mark within the string.
        <a href=""></a> - Notes Chapter 3: Destructuring an array is the concept of taking values 
        out of an array and presenting them as individual values.
        Destructuring allows us to assign multiple values at the same time, using arrays:
        const [x,y] = [1,2];
        Even though the assignment is made using arrays, each individual variable exists on its own 
        outside the array. We can see this by checking the value of each variable:
        x
        << 1
        y
        << 2
        Destructuring also gives us a neat way of swapping the value of two variables over:
        [x,y] = [y,x];
        x
        << 2
        y
        << 1
        To remove the last item from an array, we can use the pop() method
        The shift() method works in a similar way to the pop() method, but this removes the first item in the array
        The push() method appends a new value to the end of the array.
        The unshift() method is similar to the push() method, but this appends a new item to the beginning of the array
        The join() method can be used to turn the array into a string that comprises all the items in the array, separated by commas:
        You can choose a separator other than a comma by placing it inside the parentheses. Let’s try using an ampersand:
        avengers.join(' & ');
        The slice() method creates a subarray; effectively chopping out a slice of an original array, starting at one position and 
        finishing at another. Note that this operation is non-destructive ― no items are actually removed from the array.
        The splice() method removes items from an array then inserts new items in their place. This is a destructive operation as it
        changes the value of the array, as we can see below:
        avengers
        << ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'Hulk', 'Hawkeye', 'Black Widow']
        avengers.splice(3, 1, 'Scarlet Witch');
        << ['Hulk']
        avengers
        << ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'Scarlet Witch', 'Hawkeye', 'Black Widow']
        The first number in the parentheses tells us the index at which to start the splice. The second number tells us how 
        many items to remove from the array.
        Notice the splice() method returns the items removed from the array as a subarray. So in the example, it returned 
        the array ['Hulk'] .
        The splice() method can also be used to insert values into an array at a specific index without removing any items, by indicating 
        that zero items are to be removed.
        ES6 introduced an improved iterator function for arrays called a for-of loop that uses a slightly different syntax:
        for(const value of avengers){
        console.log(value);
        }
        << 'Black Widow'
        << 'Captain America'
        << 'Hawkeye'
        << 'Iron Man'
        << 'Quicksilver'
        << 'Scarlet Witch'
        This replaces all of the setup of a ‘for’ loop with a variable ( value in the example above) that represents the value of 
        each element in the array. Note that this variable needs to be declared using const
