        - Notes Chapter 2 - Template literals use the backtick character `, 
        which has the advantage of being able to use both types of quote mark within the string.

        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        - Chapter 3: Destructuring an array is the concept of taking values out of an array and<br> 
        presenting them as individual values.<br>
        Destructuring allows us to assign multiple values at the same time, using arrays:<br>
        const [x,y] = [1,2];<br>
        Even though the assignment is made using arrays, each individual variable exists on its own<br> 
        outside the array. We can see this by checking the value of each variable:<br>
        x<br>
        << 1<br>
        y<br>
        << 2<br>
        Destructuring also gives us a neat way of swapping the value of two variables over:<br>
        [x,y] = [y,x];<br>
        x<br>
        << 2<br>
        y<br>
        << 1<br>
        To remove the last item from an array, we can use the pop() method<br>
        The shift() method works in a similar way to the pop() method, but this removes the first item in the array<br>
        The push() method appends a new value to the end of the array.<br>
        The unshift() method is similar to the push() method, but this appends a new item to the beginning of the array<br>
        The join() method can be used to turn the array into a string that comprises all the items in the array, separated by commas:<br>
        You can choose a separator other than a comma by placing it inside the parentheses. Let’s try using an ampersand:<br>
        avengers.join(' & ');<br>
        The slice() method creates a subarray; effectively chopping out a slice of an original array, starting at one position and<br> 
        finishing at another. Note that this operation is non-destructive ― no items are actually removed from the array.<br>
        The splice() method removes items from an array then inserts new items in their place. This is a destructive operation as it<br>
        changes the value of the array, as we can see below:<br>
        avengers<br>
        << ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'Hulk', 'Hawkeye', 'Black Widow']<br>
        avengers.splice(3, 1, 'Scarlet Witch');<br>
        << ['Hulk']<br>
        avengers<br>
        << ['Captain America', 'Iron Man', 'Thor', 'Scarlet Witch', 'Hawkeye', 'Black Widow']<br>
        The first number in the parentheses tells us the index at which to start the splice. The second number tells us how<br> 
        many items to remove from the array.<br>
        Notice the splice() method returns the items removed from the array as a subarray. So in the example, it returned<br> 
        the array ['Hulk'] .<br>
        The splice() method can also be used to insert values into an array at a specific index without removing any items, by indicating<br> 
        that zero items are to be removed.<br>
        ES6 introduced an improved iterator function for arrays called a for-of loop that uses a slightly different syntax:<br>
        for(const value of avengers){<br>
        console.log(value);<br>
        }<br>
        << 'Black Widow'<br>
        << 'Captain America'<br>
        << 'Hawkeye'<br>
        << 'Iron Man'<br>
        << 'Quicksilver'<br>
        << 'Scarlet Witch'<br>
        This replaces all of the setup of a ‘for’ loop with a variable ( value in the example above) that represents the value of<br> 
        each element in the array. Note that this variable needs to be declared using const.
