    <h2>Week01</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="story_editor.html">Write a story</a> - You can write a story, save it, edit it,
         and display it on local storage - Not very many notes on this one, my main focus was mostly on exercises.
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Why use local storage instead of a database? 
            Should we use local storage and avoid sessions
            until it is absolutely necessary?
